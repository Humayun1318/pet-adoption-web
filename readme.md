# Pet Adoption Website

## Project Description
The Pet Adoption Website is a functional web application designed to help users explore and adopt pets from various categories. The website fetches data from external APIs to display information about pets, such as breed, gender, price, and vaccination status. Users can browse pets, like their favorites, and adopt them directly. The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features
1. **Browse Pets**: View a variety of pets with essential details like breed, gender, birth date, price, and vaccination status.
2. **Pet Categories**: Filter pets by categories (e.g., dogs, cats, etc.) to easily find the pet that suits your preferences.
3. **Pet Details**: Each pet has a dedicated page displaying detailed information such as breed, name, age, price, and adoption status.
4. **Like and Adopt Pets**: Users can click the like button to add pets picture to their favorite list, and adopt them directly through the interface.
5. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across all device sizes, from desktop to mobile.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for concise function expressions and better readability.
- **Async/Await**: Employed for handling asynchronous operations like fetching data from APIs.
- **Template Literals**: Used for easy string interpolation and embedding dynamic content in HTML.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Used for extracting values from objects and arrays in a cleaner, more efficient manner.
- **Promises**: Used for handling asynchronous tasks, especially in fetching data from external APIs.

## Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: The website utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid and flexible design.
- **Custom CSS**: Custom CSS is used alongside Tailwind to further refine the design and make it unique to the project.
